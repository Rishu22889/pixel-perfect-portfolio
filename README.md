# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my portfolio. This is where I showcase my work, share my journey, and hopefully convince you that I know what I'm doing (most of the time).

**Check it out live:** https://portfolio-alpha-pied-63.vercel.app/

## What's This All About?

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies. It's clean, responsive, and actually loads fast (I promise). You'll find my projects, skills, experience, and a way to get in touch if you want to chat.

## Built With

I kept things modern and practical:

- **React** - Because who doesn't love components?
- **TypeScript** - For when JavaScript needs adult supervision
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds that don't make you wait
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling that just works
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful components without the headache
- **EmailJS** - Contact form that actually sends emails

## Running It Locally

Want to tinker around? Here's how:

```bash
# Clone it
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Jump in
cd pixel-perfect-portfolio

# Install the goods
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then head to `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Check for code issues
npm run test         # Run tests
```

## Want to Deploy Your Own?

This thing works great on:
- **Vercel** (my personal favorite - literally one click)
- **Netlify** (also super easy)
- **GitHub Pages** (if you're into that)

Just connect your repo and let the platform do its magic.

## A Few Notes

- The contact form uses EmailJS, so you'll need to set up your own account and update the credentials
- Images are in the `public` folder - swap them out with your own
- All the content lives in the component files under `src/components`
- Feel free to customize colors in `tailwind.config.ts`

## Questions?

If something's not working or you're stuck, feel free to open an issue. I'll try to help when I can (no promises on response time though - life happens).
